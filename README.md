# Custom Dynamic Vehicle Spawner
DayZ Epoch/Overpoch Custom Dynamic Vehicle Spawner

This will modify the dynamic vehicle spawner so that planes will spawn in hangars and runway positions.
It will detect if you are running Overpoch or Epoch/Overpoch with Origins 1.7.9.5 and add the vehicles from those mods to the dynamic spawning vehicle list.

Overwatch will add the 350z, Armed Camel, and Holden Monaro variants.
Origins will add the scrap vehicles.
